# Android Weather Application
Android Weather application using Yahoo! Weather API to fetch weather based on current location.

Uses either GPS or a custom input ZIP code to find current location. Yahoo! Weather data is fetched in XML format and parsed into a `Forecast` object. Most current weather conditions are stored locally for quick retrieval on startup. Custom forecast animations are done via a WebView using a HTML5 canvas. Application was developed using SCRUM methodologies. Developed for Android SDK version 23 and tested on Google Nexus 5.
